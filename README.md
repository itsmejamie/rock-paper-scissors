The Odin Project - Rock, paper and scissors

V1.0 23 October 2022.

This project took me a very long time to get through, however I found the challenge rewarding. 

Breaking it down into multiple smaller part was definitely the way to go. Defining computerChoice taught me about arrays and the math.random function. Defining playerChoice taught me about prompts and how to record that information. 

The biggest challenge for me was actually learning how to write my own functions. After that the logic made sense. I'll admit that I still don't fully understand it. However, hopefully with repetition this becomes more obvious. My friend Leno was able to walk me through loops, again don't fully make sense to me. 

I'm happy that I was able to figure out how to keep score and then get the project to completion - running exactly how I wanted it to. 

The only missing part is the case sensitive input. So I may revisit that at some point.
